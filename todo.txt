- [] Universe::addObject() - add protection agains adding two objects in the same place
- [] Object::setPosition - use enums for coordinate indexes
- [] Universe::getForce - implement force acting on objects, depending on the potential map. Assume force acts only in a single direction,
                          e.g. divU = d/dx U
- [] Universe::detectCollisionsWithWalls() - if ball moves outside the box, move it back inside. Now only momentum reflection is implemented
- [] Vector3D - addprotection agains accessing elementes outside vector range
